# Brand monitoring flow using DeepSeek-R1, CrewAI and BrightData

This project implements an automated brand monitoring system using AI agents. We use the following tools to build this:
- [Bright Data](https://brdta.com/dailydoseofds) is used to scrape the web.
- CrewAI to build the Agentic workflow.
- DeepSeek-R1 as the LLM.

The brand monitoring output is shown here: [Sample output](brand-monitoring-demo.mp4)
